# Implementation Plan: Animated Library View

## Branch Name
feat/library-view-animated

## Background and Motivation
We want a new Library view that matches the provided screenshot: a left navigation sidebar, a searchable list in the middle, and a rich details panel on the right. Animations should feel smooth and delightful using our existing GSAP utilities.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Achieving a faithful 3‑pane layout in the App Router while keeping components server/client boundaries clean.
- Reusing existing animation helpers (`components/AnimatedSection`, `components/AnimatedFilters`, `hooks/useAnimations.ts`).
- Keeping strict TypeScript and lint rules green.

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] Create feature branch from `main` named `feat/library-view-animated`.
- [x] Scaffold `app/library/page.tsx` with 3‑pane layout.
- [x] Implement animated sidebar with filters and create button.
- [x] Implement animated list with search and selection state.
- [ ] Implement animated right details panel including header actions and step card.
- [ ] Polish styles to closely match the screenshot (spacing/typography/pills).
- [ ] Build and lint until green; fix any regressions.
- [ ] Open draft PR and capture demo video/gif.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The new route is available at `/library` and renders without errors.
- Sidebar: shows Type, Filters, Categories; filter pills animate in.
- List: search input animates in; list items stagger-in and highlight when selected.
- Details: animates on selection change with slide/opacity; includes Use button and a step card similar to the screenshot.
- No new TypeScript errors in added files; overall project still builds.

## Testing Strategy
- Manual: navigate to `/library`, try searching, selecting items, and observe animations.
- Lint/build: `npm run build` must succeed; run `npm run lint` if needed.

## Project Status Board
- [x] Branch created
- [x] Scaffolded route
- [x] Sidebar implemented
- [x] List + search implemented
- [ ] Details panel implemented
- [ ] Styling polish
- [ ] Build/lint green
- [ ] Draft PR open
